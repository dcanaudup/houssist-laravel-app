# Tasks

---

When a homeowner accepts an offer from a service provider in one of their ads, a task will be automatically be created to track its progress. You can view all your tasks in the **My Tasks** page.

- [Task Progress](#task-progress)
- [Task Disputes](#task-disputes)

## Task Progress

- While the task date is not yet due, the task will remain in the **Waiting** status.
- Once the date has arrived, the task will automatically be set to **In Progress**.
- As a service provider, you will then need to accomplish the task as agreed upon.
- When the task is completed, you need to go the **My Tasks** page, view the specific task and update the task status to **Completed**.
- The homeowner will then need to verify the task and release the payment to the service provider based on the payment method. They will then update the status to **Paid**.

## Task Disputes

- In case the task was not completed according to what was agreed upon, the homeowner can dispute the task and withhold the payment to you.
- A support ticket will then be created for the dispute.
- An admin will then review the dispute and decide whether to release the payment to the service provider or refund the payment to the homeowner.
