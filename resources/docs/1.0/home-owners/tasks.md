# Tasks

---

Once you have accepted an offer from a service provider in one of your ads, a task will be automatically be created to track its progress.

## Task Progress

- While the task date is not yet due, the task will remain in the **Waiting** status.
- Once the date has arrived, the task will automatically be set to **In Progress**.
- The service provider will then need to accomplish the task as agreed upon.
- When the task is completed, the service provider needs to update the task status to **Completed**.
- The homeowner will then need to verify the task and release the payment to the service provider based on the payment method. They will then update the status to **Paid**.

## Task Disputes

- In case the task was not completed according to what was agreed upon, the homeowner can dispute the task and withhold the payment to the service provider.
- A support ticket will then be created for the dispute.
- An admin will then review the dispute and decide whether to release the payment to the service provider or refund the payment to the homeowner.
